## Disclaimer

This system is designed for **educational and research purposes**. All trading involves risk, and past performance does not guarantee future results. Users should:

- Perform thorough backtesting before any live deployment
- **Pay attention to transaction costs** - our enhanced system shows their significant impact
- Consider real-world slippage and market impact beyond our models
- Understand that model performance can degrade over time
- Validate all signals with proper risk management
- **Focus on Net PnL** - gross returns can be misleading for HFT strategies
